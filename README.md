# PlantDoc: Harvesting Hope with AI ðŸŒ±

## Overview
PlantDoc is an AI-driven tool that leverages a dataset of over 56,000 images across 38 plant species to detect plant diseases at an early stage. This project aims to significantly reduce crop losses and enhance agricultural productivity, transforming the way farmers and agronomists approach plant health management.

## Model
Our model is trained using transfer learning on the VGG16 architecture. It is capable of identifying 38 different plant diseases, making it a comprehensive tool for plant health management.

## Team
This project was created during the Computing and Informatics class (CI-102 AND CI-103) by a team of four dedicated students:

- Saksham Rajbhandari
- Krithi Hari
- Naman Bajpai
- Manish Gurung

## Future Work
We will soon feature an LLM to give more details about the disease's symptoms and potential cures.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to our professors and peers in the Computing and Informatics class for their support and guidance throughout the development of this project.
