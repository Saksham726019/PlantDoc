# PlantDoc : Harvesting Hope with AI

Project Description
PlantDoc is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the detection and diagnosis of plant diseases. By utilizing a dataset of over 56,000 images covering 38 different plant species, PlantDoc employs state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques with the VGG16 model. This enables the accurate identification of plant diseases, providing an essential resource for farmers and agronomists to manage crop health more effectively.

Key Features:
Comprehensive Dataset: Utilizes a diverse dataset for robust disease detection.
Advanced AI Techniques: Leverages VGG16 for high accuracy in disease classification.
Impactful Application: Aims to reduce crop losses and improve agricultural productivity through early disease detection.
