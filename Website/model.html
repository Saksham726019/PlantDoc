        <section class="model-details">
            <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
            <p>Our model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model, a state-of-the-art
                neural network architecture for image recognition. It processes images with a batch size of 32 and an input size of 224 x 224 pixels across 33 different plant diseases.</p>
            <p>The model has been trained for 50 epochs on a dataset that includes over 56,000 images spanning 33 distinct plant diseases.
                This extensive training has enabled our model to achieve an impressive 97.6% accuracy in identifying a wide range of plant diseases.
                This showcases the modelâ€™s robustness and high performance in plant disease recognition.</p>

            <h2>Performance and Accuracy</h2>
            <p>The effectiveness of our model is evident in its precision and the confidence level it achieves in predictions.
                Through rigorous testing and optimization, we ensure that our model meets the high standards required for real-world applications in agriculture.</p>
